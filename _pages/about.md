I am a final-year CS Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/). Previously, I visited National University of Singapore (NUS) from Nov 2023 to Jun 2024. (working with Prof. [Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/), Prof. [Bryan Hooi](https://bhooi.github.io/) and Prof. [Zemin Liu](https://zemin-liu.github.io/)).

My current research interests lie primarily in the area of **Machine Learning and Data Mining on Graphs**, including but not limited to graph neural networks, graph pre-training, and real-world applications on graphs. Moreover, in this era of LLMs, I am dedicated to building Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) and developing specialized graph LLMs.

‚≠êÔ∏è The main goal of my Ph.D. research is to build generalizable graph models and frameworks, capable of learning from rich and complex graph data and enhancing their utility across diverse downstream tasks and datasets.
