I am a CS Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, fortunately advised by Prof. [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/). Currently, I am visiting National University of Singapore (working with Prof. [Bingsheng He](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~hebs/), Prof. [Bryan Hooi](https://bhooi.github.io/) and Prof. [Zemin Liu](https://zemin-liu.github.io/)).

My current research interests lie primarily in the area of **Machine Learning and Data Mining on Graphs**, including but not limited to graph neural networks, graph pre-training, and real-world applications on graphs. Moreover, in this era of LLMs, I hope to contribute my efforts to the Graph foundation model and Graph LLMs.

Ongoing Work
------
- Towards Graph Foundation Model across Domains. 
- Graph LLM for Zero-Shot Multi-Label Node Classification.
- Tackling Multi-label Node Classification. (Under Review)
