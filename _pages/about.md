Welcome to Yifei Sun's Personal Homepage! 

I am a CS Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University (ZJU), fortunately advised by Prof. [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/), and worked closely with Prof. [Jiarong Xu](https://galina0217.github.io/) from Fudan University.

My current research interests lie primarily in the area of **Machine Learning and Data Mining on Graphs**, including but not limited to graph neural networks, graph pre-training, and real-world applications on graphs.
